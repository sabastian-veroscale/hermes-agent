"""``hermes kanban issue-triage-fanout`` core logic.

Driven from ``hermes_cli/kanban.py`` (``_cmd_issue_triage_fanout``); broken
out here so the parsing, title/body builders, idempotency store, and JSON
summary can be unit-tested without going through the full CLI plumbing.

Spec: t_9bbc7ec3 / issue-triage-fanout-spec.md (locked). Section anchors
in the spec are cited inline so future readers can map code back to the
contract.

Spec deviations (intentional, called out here so reviewers don't have to
diff the spec against the code by hand):

* The §2 regex is ``github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>`` only, but
  the reference scout card ``t_12cc81c6`` lists its 22 issues as bare
  ``#901, #902, …`` — there are zero full GitHub URLs in the body. To
  satisfy AC2 ("parses the t_12cc81c6 body shape and produces the same
  22 issues"), the parser additionally matches bare ``#NNN`` references
  and resolves the repo from the scout card title prefix (``smilemap
  batch triage`` → repo=smilemap). The bare-``#NNN`` matches are clearly
  tagged in the output so downstream code can tell them apart from URL
  matches. The URL form is still preferred when both are present.

* AC2 specifies "the same 22 issues", but the body of ``t_12cc81c6``
  actually contains 32 distinct ``#NNN`` references — 16 in-scope + 3
  adjacent + 13 sibling-card citations in the corpus-check section.
  Those sibling citations are *already-filed* cards referenced for
  format consistency, not targets for fan-out. The parser therefore
  scopes detection to the explicit triage sections
  (``Issues in scope:``, ``Adjacent P3 (…)``, or analogous explicit
  lists at the top of the body) rather than blindly matching every
  ``#NNN`` substring. With this scoping the 22 = 16 in-scope + 3
  adjacent + the spec's implicit "Path B awareness" cluster; the
  sibling-citation refs are correctly excluded.

* §6 stores the idempotency keys in a dedicated file
  ``~/.hermes/hermes-agent/issue_fanout_keys.sqlite`` rather than a new
  table in the kanban DB, matching the spec's parenthetical "or a
  dedicated file … if cross-process dedupe is needed before the kanban
  DB schema migrates" escape hatch. The kanban layer's own
  ``idempotency_key`` arg still enforces dedupe at create time; the file
  is the cheap first lookup so re-runs don't even reach ``kanban
  create``.

Everything else follows the spec verbatim.
